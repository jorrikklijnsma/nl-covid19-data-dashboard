If, for example, the graph shows that people in their sixties represent 12% of the Dutch population (grey bar) and that this same group represents 10% of the people in the Netherlands who have died with COVID-19 (blue bar), that means there are proportionately fewer deaths with COVID-19 among people in their sixties.
